# 🎭 Persona-Driven LLM: Chandler Bing Edition  

An optimized **Llama-3** model fine-tuned to capture **Chandler Bing's** distinctive sarcastic persona.  

This project leverages **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** techniques, powered by the **Unsloth framework** for efficient deployment and inference.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This repository showcases a specialized **Large Language Model (LLM)** designed to emulate the iconic sarcastic wit of Chandler Bing from *"Friends"*.  

Built upon the powerful **Llama-3 architecture**, the model has undergone a rigorous fine-tuning process using both **Supervised Fine-Tuning** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback** via **Direct Preference Optimization** to precisely sculpt its responses and reflect Chandler’s unique comedic style.
