I just Bamboozled Chandler!,This game makes no sense!

"Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses.","The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
But you're not bald.,It's not on my head.
We're here to celebrate our love together. We don't have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.,We need the stuff.
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Oh, wow. That's amazing. I'm sure the 37 therapists and 12 rabbits you'll eventually need will be thrilled."
Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows!,"Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this."
You got ink on your lip.,Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
"No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.",Where did you hear it from before?
I just got engaged to my perfect match.,"Wow, that's amazing. I'm sure the 37 online quizzes you took had nothing to do with it."
"How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.","Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?"
Higher or lower than what?,This is embarrassing.
I'm considering a career change to professional snail trainer.,"Oh, finally, a job that utilizes your vast experience in slowing things down."
Yeah,"Yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
Plus! He actually has everything.,Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, a soulmate. How convenient. Now you'll never have to use Tinder again."
Still doing the screening thing?,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
"We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music...","Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen.","Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?"
"I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!",You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
No we didn't!,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
Maybe they don't trust us with the keys.,No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
"I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!",We didn't give you any money!
"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.",Hi! And you're going into what grade?
"Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.",Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
I'm sorry to do this to you again but is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit?,"Ohhh, well of course I will watch him, we have fun don't we Ben?"
"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",... And where's this money coming from?
"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!","Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
Joey finished the entire turkey by himself,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
How could you tell her?,I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
"Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.",He thought you said gonad.
Remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.,I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
I really think that you should apologize to Julie.,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!"
That's true.,The man's got a point.
I'm feeling really confident about this date tonight.,"Yeah, because nothing screams 'catch' like a guy who still lives with his parents and owns a velour tracksuit."
"Ohh, I'm sorry.",Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
"Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",No. Really?
I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!,"Well, it is overdue."
Oh my God! What happened?,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
Does she have a problem with me or something?,Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.,"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!"
I just got engaged to the love of my life.,"Oh, wonderful. Because what every relationship needs is a legally binding contract and a lifetime of resentment."
"I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",Are you aware that you're still talking?
"No, not since I lost her at the airport.",I can't believe she can out run you man!
What does that mean?,"Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?"
Ross Geller: I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
What did you guys just do?,Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
"Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.",That's what's weird?
What would have done if I said yes?,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door."
"Do you not see that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.",I've watched home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
You look like you're gonna be the...,"All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it."
"Rachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.",Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Now she's passed.,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
I'm considering a career change to professional clown.,"Oh, fantastic! Because the world really needs more adults in oversized pants, crying on the inside."
I'm so excited for my first day of couples therapy.,"Yeah, because nothing strengthens a relationship like paying a stranger to watch you fight."
You could hire Joey as an actor and have him dress up and put on little skits.,Well that would help the pride thing.
Parker seems like a nice guy.,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.","I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!","Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.,I see where you're goin'!
I just got engaged to the love of my life.,"Oh, wow! Could this be the start of a beautiful, crippling codependency?"
I've decided to start writing a novel.,"Oh, great, because the world was just missing a 500-page manuscript about your feelings."
You have really great hair.,"Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!"
Why do the kids need a youth center anyway!,They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
"Hey! New wallet, huh?","Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore."
"Monica: Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Monica: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
"Phoebe Buffay: Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.",Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
You realize what you are don't you?,What?
What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
If it's a boy it's Daniel. If it's a girl?,"Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?"
"So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.",Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.,"Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man."
You come off a little needy.,Did you like me when we first met?
"You look, you look...big.","Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?"
Which part exactly?,The whole thing! Can we go?
I've decided to start writing a novel.,"Oh, great, because the world was just missing a 500-page manuscript about your feelings."
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, a soulmate. How convenient. Now you'll have someone to share your therapist with."
"Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.",There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
What's this called?,"Uh, boat rope."
They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!,They know you know.
"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.","Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.","Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
I've decided to become a professional snail trainer.,"Oh, great, because the world was just missing a hero who can make a snail move at a glacial pace for a living."
"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!","Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
Who is Maria?,"Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat."
"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!",And this- is my reward!
"I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him..","Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God.."
"Phoebe Buffay: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.",Might wanna open with the snowman.
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, that's great. I'm sure the 37 minutes you've known them is a solid foundation for a lifetime of love and resentment."
Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?,That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?,"Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row."
"Monica Geller: That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future...",I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
I just got engaged to the love of my life.,"Wow, that's great. I'm sure the 37 others you've said that about are just thrilled."
"No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.","Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?"
"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?","Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"
Joey wins again and Chandler owes him $500,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."

"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...",Cookie?
"Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing!","It's just, it's just steep!"
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, that's amazing. I'm sure the 37 minutes you've known them is a solid foundation for a lifetime of love and not at all a desperate cry for help."
I'm so excited for my blind date tonight.,"Oh, yeah, because nothing says 'true love' like a stranger who's only seen your Facebook profile picture."
I don't know who made you the boss?,Please! I made this game what it is.
You went through my personal property?,Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel.","And that's the trail, I did it!"
"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.","Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
I've decided to start writing a novel.,"Oh, great. Because the world was just missing a 500-page manuscript about your feelings."

You should apologize to each other and mean it.,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing."
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, that's great. I'm sure the 37 other girls you've called your soulmate will be thrilled to hear that."

I didn't know you read tea leaves.,"Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots."

You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.,And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there.
I just got engaged to my girlfriend.,"Oh, great. Because nothing says 'I love you' like a ring that's 2 months' rent and a lifelong commitment to listening to her snore."

I didn't take a pregnancy test.,Then...who did?

What did you take a picture of?,Nothing! It was something.
Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?,"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
That's not pretty!,Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!,"I was not and oh God, shh!"
What was your first favorite game?,"Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something."
I am an excellent driver!,You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Ross Geller: I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.,No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.

How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?,"You, you are gonna love this."
"Oh, can we read them?","Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine."
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
I like it in the stern.,...of the boat. Hello.
I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, congratulations! Could I BE any happier for you and your impending doom of lifelong compromise and dishwasher arguments?"

"Could you just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment!",I should go live under somebody's stairs!
"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",I am pretending.
When I proposed to him with the ring I got goose bumps.,Maybe it was the guy.
"My God, you're choking! That better?",Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
From the tequila factory?,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
"Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.","Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained."
"Rachel Green: I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.","Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here."

Hey what are you guys looking at?,Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.","Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
What's wrong with the foosball table?,"See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."

"Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?",Your last roommate's kidney?
I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?,Maybe it's something you ate?
"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.","Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."

"We're talking about whipped fish, Monica.","I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"

"She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!","Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!"

I just got engaged to my soulmate.,"Wow, congratulations! Could I BE any happier for you and your impending doom?"
"Joey Tribbiani: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
You wanted to talk to me?,"I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?"
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,Oh! Pathetic!
I'm a little embarrassed about it.,"So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened."
What's that?,"Oh, that's my arm!"
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.","Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."

OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'","Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
Is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.',Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'","Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh..."
"God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'","Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum."

Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.,"Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!"
"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",I didn't know you had another level.
No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.,But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
What's wrong with you?,"Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do."

"How did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?","Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
